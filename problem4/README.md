# Problem 4

I used 3 way to handle sum func. 

## Formula Approach
Time Complexity: O(1).
Space Complexity: O(1).

## Divide and Conquer Approach
Time Complexity: O(log n).
Space Complexity: O(log n).

## Binary Search Approach
Time Complexity: O(log n).
Space Complexity: O(1).

## Guide to test

```
- cd ./problem4
- node sum.js
```
